# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of **GovAct**, pledge to make participation in this project a respectful, safe, and constructive experience for everyone.

GovAct is a public-interest project focused on documentation, visibility, and durability.  
The subject matter can be serious and emotionally charged, but that does not excuse harmful behavior.

---

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Focusing on evidence, clarity, and constructive feedback
- Accepting feedback gracefully
- Prioritizing safety and harm reduction
- Engaging in good faith

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or threats
- Doxxing or sharing private information (even hypothetically)
- Sexualized language or imagery
- Hate speech or discriminatory remarks
- Targeting individuals or groups
- Encouraging confrontation, evasion, or real-world interference
- Bad-faith engagement, sealioning, or deliberate derailment
- Using “passion” or “urgency” as justification for abuse

These standards apply to **all project spaces**, including code, issues, pull requests, discussions, and external representations of the project.

---

## Safety and Scope

Because GovAct deals with real-world events that affect real people:

- Discussions must not speculate about private individuals
- Contributors must not attempt to identify or track individuals
- No content should increase the risk of harm to any person or community

This applies even in hypothetical or technical discussions.

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and enforcing this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:

- Removing or editing content
- Issuing warnings
- Temporarily or permanently banning contributors
- Locking discussions or issues

Enforcement decisions are made to protect the project and its contributors, not to adjudicate intent.

---

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Do **not** escalate publicly
- Do **not** retaliate
- Report the issue privately via the project repository or designated contact method

Reports will be reviewed in good faith and handled as discreetly as possible.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will consider:

- Severity and impact of the behavior
- Safety or privacy risk
- Whether it is part of a pattern
- The contributor’s response when concerns are raised

Not all violations receive warnings.  
Severe or unsafe behavior may result in immediate action.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant**, version 2.1.

---

## Final Note

GovAct exists to make information visible **without turning people into targets**.

Respect, restraint, and care are foundational to the project.
