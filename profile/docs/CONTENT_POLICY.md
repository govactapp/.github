# Content Policy

GovAct exists to provide **situational awareness and durable documentation** while minimizing harm to individuals and communities.

This Content Policy defines what may and may not be submitted to the platform, and how content is evaluated for safety, legality, and integrity.

All users and contributors are expected to follow this policy.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to all user-submitted content, including:

- Community reports
- Text descriptions
- Uploaded media (images or files)
- Comments or annotations (if enabled)
- Metadata associated with submissions

This policy does **not** apply to the **Verified Public Events** timeline, which is curated separately based on independent reporting and documentation.

---

## Guiding Principles

Content decisions are guided by:

- **Safety over sensationalism**
- **Documentation over opinion**
- **Visibility without targeting**
- **Neutral presentation**
- **Harm reduction**

GovAct documents observable events and reported outcomes; it does not adjudicate intent, moral worth, or political conclusions.

GovAct is not a forum, social network, or coordination tool.

---

## Allowed Content

The following types of content are generally allowed, provided they comply with all other sections of this policy:

- Descriptions of observed government activity relevant to the platform’s scope
- Reports of encounters or incidents affecting communities
- Approximate locations and timeframes of events
- Factual descriptions of what occurred
- Media depicting events, provided it does not expose private individuals

All allowed content is treated as **unverified** unless explicitly part of the Verified Public Events timeline.

---

## Prohibited Content

The following content is **not permitted** on GovAct:

### 1. Doxxing and Personal Identification

- Exact home addresses
- Names or uniquely identifying details of private individuals
- License plates or other uniquely identifying markers
- Attempts to identify specific agents or officers outside of official reporting

---

### 2. Calls to Action or Interference

- Encouragement to confront, follow, or interfere with government activity
- Instructions for evading law enforcement
- Real-time coordination or alerts intended for immediate action

GovAct is not a coordination or warning system.

---

### 3. Hate, Harassment, or Threats

- Hate speech or discriminatory content
- Harassment, intimidation, or threats
- Dehumanizing language toward any group or individual

---

### 4. Sexualized or Exploitative Content

- Sexualized depictions of individuals
- Exploitative imagery, especially involving minors
- Content intended to humiliate or degrade

---

### 5. False or Malicious Submissions

- Knowingly false reports
- Submissions intended to mislead, provoke panic, or harass
- Repeated low-quality or spam submissions

---

### 6. Political Messaging or Editorial Content

- Slogans, manifestos, or advocacy messaging
- Content intended primarily to persuade or inflame
- Opinion pieces presented as factual reports

GovAct documents events; it does not host political commentary.

---

## Media-Specific Rules

When uploading media:

- Embedded metadata (such as EXIF location data) may be removed
- Media must not reveal exact residential locations
- Faces of private individuals may be subject to removal or obscuring
- Media depicting minors is subject to heightened scrutiny

Media uploads that increase the risk of identifying individuals may be removed even if the underlying event is allowed.

---

## Moderation Actions

Content that violates this policy may be subject to one or more actions:

- Removal from public view
- Request for clarification or revision
- Permanent removal
- Account-level restrictions for repeated violations

Moderation decisions are made to protect safety and integrity, not to adjudicate intent.

---

## Appeals and Corrections

Where feasible:

- Users may request review of moderation decisions
- Factual corrections may be submitted
- Additional context may be considered

GovAct is not obligated to host content that poses ongoing safety risks.

---

## Enforcement Philosophy

Moderation is applied:

- Consistently
- Transparently
- With documented reasoning where possible

Severity, context, and potential harm are considered in all decisions.

---

## Forks and Independent Deployments

GovAct is open source and may be deployed independently by third parties.

This Content Policy applies only to deployments operated by the GovAct maintainers.  
Forks or derivative deployments may adopt different policies.

---

## Final Note

GovAct exists to make patterns visible **without making people targets**.

Content that undermines that goal — regardless of intent — does not belong on the platform.
