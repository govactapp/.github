# Moderation Policy

GovAct exists to provide **situational awareness and durable documentation** while minimizing harm to individuals and communities.

Moderation is a necessary part of that mission. This document explains how moderation works, how decisions are made, and how the process may evolve over time.

---

## Moderation Philosophy

GovAct moderation is guided by:

- **Safety over completeness**
- **Consistency over discretion**
- **Documentation over judgment**
- **Transparency over opacity**

Moderation is not used to shape narratives or suppress disagreement.  
It exists solely to reduce harm, protect privacy, and preserve platform integrity.

---

## Scope of Moderation

Moderation applies to:

- Community reports
- Text descriptions
- Uploaded media
- Metadata associated with submissions
- User behavior related to submissions (e.g., repeated abuse, evasion attempts)

Moderation does **not** apply to the **Verified Public Events** timeline in the same way, as those entries are curated separately based on independent sources.

---

## Moderation States

Community-submitted content may exist in one of the following states:

- **Visible** — publicly displayed
- **Flagged** — under review due to potential policy concerns
- **Hidden** — removed from public view but retained internally
- **Removed** — permanently removed due to severe or repeated violations

State transitions should be applied consistently and based on policy criteria.

---

## What Triggers Moderation Review

Content may be flagged for review due to:

- User reports or flags
- Automated abuse detection and heuristics
- Moderator review
- Policy updates that affect existing content

Flagging does not imply wrongdoing — it indicates the need for review.

---

## Review Criteria

When reviewing content, moderators consider:

- Compliance with `CONTENT_POLICY.md`
- Risk of harm to individuals or communities
- Presence of identifying or sensitive information
- Context, timing, and severity
- Whether safer alternatives exist (e.g., redaction vs removal)

Intent is not assumed and is not the primary factor in decisions.

---

## Moderation Actions

Possible moderation actions include:

- No action (content remains visible)
- Request for clarification or modification
- Partial redaction (e.g., removing identifying details)
- Hiding content from public view
- Permanent removal

Actions are chosen based on **minimum necessary intervention**.

---

## Appeals and Corrections

Where feasible:

- Users may request review of moderation decisions
- Corrections or additional context may be submitted
- Decisions may be revisited if new information becomes available

GovAct is not obligated to host content that poses ongoing safety risks.

---

## Transparency and Logging

Moderation actions are:

- Logged internally (where supported)
- Applied using documented criteria
- Subject to review by maintainers

As the project matures, GovAct may introduce:

- Public transparency reports
- Aggregate moderation statistics
- Documented policy change logs

---

## Policy Changes and Versioning

Moderation policy and enforcement logic are not static.

Changes may occur in response to:

- Real-world use patterns
- Abuse trends
- Contributor feedback
- Legal and safety considerations
- Lessons learned in operation

Changes should be:

- documented in version control
- reflected in updated policy documents
- applied prospectively where feasible

---

## Maintainer Responsibility

Moderation decisions are made by project maintainers acting in good faith.

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Applying policies consistently
- Prioritizing safety and privacy
- Avoiding arbitrary or retaliatory actions
- Updating policies when existing approaches prove insufficient

Moderation authority exists to protect the project and its users, not to silence disagreement.

---

## Forks and Independent Deployments

GovAct is open source and may be deployed independently by third parties.

This moderation policy applies only to deployments operated by the GovAct maintainers.  
Forks or derivative deployments may adopt different moderation approaches and policies.

---

## Closing Note

Moderation is an ongoing process, not a finished design.

GovAct is committed to improving moderation practices over time while remaining transparent about how decisions are made and why.
